Creating a GitHub post for a TODO app is a great way to share your project with the developer community and potentially collaborate with others. Below is a template you can use for your GitHub post:

---

# TODO App

This is a simple TODO (To-Do) application built using [insert technology stack or framework here]. The app allows you to manage your tasks, mark them as completed, and organize your daily activities efficiently.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Organize tasks with categories or labels.
- Filter tasks based on their status (completed, active, or all).
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use.

## Technology Stack

- [List the technologies, libraries, or frameworks used in your project.]

## Getting Started

To get started with the TODO app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
